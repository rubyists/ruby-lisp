Introduction
============


"So what is *ruby-lisp*?", you ask.  Well, it is a module for implementing nice
Lisp features for use in Ruby.  Currently the only sub-module that exists is
Lisp::Format, which implements Lisp's (format) function and its formatting
language.  For people not familiar with this language, it is a very expressive
string formatting language, much like sprintf()'s, but much more powerful.  It
allows for iteration, case conversion, conditionals, and much more.  If you
have ever felt stupid while creating a string iteratively, to print an array or
some such, this is definitely for you!



Documentation
=============

There is extensive documentation, both of the implementation and how to
use the formatting language and its constructs, embedded in the source
using RDoc.  To generate the documentation, simply run RDoc on
format.rb::

  $ rdoc -T kilmer format.rb

You may specify whatever theme you like to the -T option (see the RDoc
documentation), or even omit it to use the default.  kilmer is a nice theme,
though, in my opinion.  RDoc can be found at http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/.
